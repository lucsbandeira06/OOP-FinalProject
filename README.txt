On this assignment assignment I had to create an E-commerce shopping website using VMC. 

I was able to implement a class for the products and another class for their categories. I also was able to display it using a Razor view where you could see products and its category.

You can access the product list by running the project and then adding /product/list at the end of the localhost url.

Unfortunately I could not finish the remaining requirements as I spent too much time working on a different project. I will definitely finish this project during summer break.
